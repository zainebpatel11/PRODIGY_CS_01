A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages. This program provides a user-friendly interface to securely process text using a specified shift value.

# Features
Encrypt or decrypt text with a customizable shift value.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving non-alphabetic characters.
Validates user input for shift values.
Offers an interactive experience with options to perform multiple operations in one session.

# How to Use
Clone the repository or download the code.
Run the script: python main.py
Follow the prompts to:
Enter your message.
Specify the shift value (integer).
Choose between encryption or decryption.
View the resulting message and continue or exit as desired.

# Purpose
This project serves as an introduction to cryptography concepts and Python programming. It is ideal for beginners to learn about text processing, modular design, and interactive console applications.
